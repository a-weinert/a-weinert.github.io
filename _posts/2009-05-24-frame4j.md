This infrastructure project facilitates the building of   
 -  robust, comfortable, nationalisable and reliable
  applications and tools for
 -  stand-alone use as well as distributed web-applications.

The main intended area of use are development, administration and process
<!--more--> control. [Frame4J][f4j_en]{: class="bbi"}
already brings some tools for these fields.

The framework (and its predecessor) have been used for critical applications
for over 13 years.
