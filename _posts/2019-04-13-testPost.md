This post is for tests only. It may be deleted when all accumulated tests passed.

### Tests planned
- comment function (notification, other users)
- author photo by account [![weinert-automation](/assets/icons_logos/weAut-logo-206-fl.png "&gt; weinert-automation"){: .imgonright height="40px" width="206px"}](https://frame4j.de/index_en.html)
- RSS feed (XML seems OK, check if it works)
- ordered sub lists (don't work)
- syntax highlighting with ` ` `  (did not work well)<br />
  It turned out that highlighting uses a lot of two letter classes that   
  might and did collide with existing CSS.

### Tests passed
- comment function (implemented as pure GitHub with issues)
- image with style (done)
- image with link  (done)
- image with size  (done)
- short URLs (permalinks)
