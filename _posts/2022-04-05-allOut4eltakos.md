To have multiple independent electrical light circuits in large or
adjacent rooms with many distributed switches for each circuit 
applying latching relays (+ pushbuttons) is a viable<!--more--> solution. 

In large or adjacent rooms one or some extra "all off" -- and 
"on again", of course -- push buttons may be required. By itself this is
is no problem.   

If a person has been forgotten and left in the now dark rooms it would be 
comfortable if pushing any light circuit's pushbutton would turn the 
(previously lit) lights on again. This might even enhance safety in some
environments. 

The [German post](allOut4eltakos_de.html "Sorry no full English text")
describes a scheme this extra comfort.   
Sorry for having no English version; my "electric English" is too poor
to avoid miss-understanding.  
Even when understanding quite few of the
[German text](allOut4eltakos_de.html) the diagrams might, hopefully,
be self explaining.
