The [German article](4switchesOn2Lines_de.html "4 Schalter an 2 Leitungen").   
Sorry for having no English version; my "electric English" is
too<!--more--> poor to avoid miss-understanding.   
Even when understanding quite few of the
[German text](4switchesOn2Lines_de.html) the diagrams might, hopefully,
be self explaining.
