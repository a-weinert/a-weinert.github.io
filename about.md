Welcome to my blog on GitHup Pages. If you know my old Wordpress blog or 
one of my sites you'll recognize the design aka theme. As well as the design 
I'll try to port the majority of posts here and shut down the old blog.

### Why leave Wordpress

After having had a Wordpress / PHP blog on 1&1 webspace running well for over
a decade and having gone through the toils of creating a theme adapted to the
design of my other web sites there was no need to change. Well I hated the 
backend and some other features, but most of that is just inconvenience.

End 2018 the provider built up pressure to switch to a new PHP version 
&mdash; 3 to 7 here &mdash; and quite rightly so. But that required a
Wordpress update  studiously avoided as long as possible. The Wordpress 
update over many revisions risked a crash but it went astonishingly fast all
seemed OK for a while. But then incompatibilities with some essential old
plug-ins arose. By activating or de-activating those plug-ins one could 
either spoil the rendering or the user administration.

### Why considering GitHub Pages and its blog features  

It showed that trying to repair the Wordpress blog ruins would neither be 
easy nor the solution beautiful. So why not use the time to learn something
new.

Additionally a bit research showed many people with a similar point of view
toward Wordpress were happy with GitHub: The best on Git is GitHub. 

### Status and to do

+ The basic learning curve is mastered: Git, Jekyll, Liquid ...

+ Ruby and all else for local development and testing is installed on
the home Windows workstation. 

+ Templates and styles were adapted to the site design.

- Content has to be made respectively ported.

- Comment feature has to be added.

### Resume 

GitHup Pages is gorgeous. The ease of local testing and deployment comes as
default.

Hopefully, GitHub and GitHub Pages last a bit longer than Google+ and Kenai 
and ...
