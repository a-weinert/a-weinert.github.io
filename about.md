Welcome to my [blog on GitHup](/index.html "content/posts see here") Pages.
If you know my old Wordpress blog or one of my sites you'll recognize the
design aka theme. After porting the the design I'll try to port the majority
of posts here and shut down the 
[old blog](https://blog.a-weinert.de/le_blog/?lang=en "to the old Wordpress blog").

### Why leave Wordpress

After having had a Wordpress / PHP blog on 1&1 webspace running well for over
a decade and having gone through the toils of creating a theme adapted to the
design of my other web sites there was no need to change. Well I hated the 
backend and some other features, but most of that is just inconvenience.

End 2018 the provider built up pressure to switch to a new PHP version 
&mdash; 3 to 7 here &mdash; and quite rightly so. But that required a
Wordpress update. As we feared an crash when updating over many revisions,
a Wordpress update was studiously avoided.<br />
But it went astonishingly fast and all seemed OK for a while. But then incompatibilities with some essential old plug-ins arose. By activating or
de-activating those plug-ins one could either spoil the rendering or 
inhibit the administration.

### Why considering GitHub Pages and its blog features  

It showed that trying to repair the Wordpress blog ruins would neither be 
easy nor the solution beautiful. So why not use the time to learn something
new.

Additionally a bit research showed many people with a similar point of view
toward Wordpress were happy with GitHub.<br /> 
Someone posted: "The best on Git is GitHub". 

### Status and to do

+ The basic learning curve is mastered: Git, Jekyll, Markdown, Liquid ...
+ Ruby and all else for local development and testing is installed on
the home Windows workstation. 
+ Templates and styles were adapted to the site design.

- Content has to be made respectively ported.
- Comment feature has to be added.

### Résumé 

GitHup Pages is gorgeous. The ease of local testing and deployment comes as
default.<br />
Hopefully, GitHub and GitHub Pages last a bit longer than Google+ and Kenai 
and ...
